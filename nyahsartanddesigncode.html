      <h2> My name is Nyah Gilmore; I was born July 5th, 1999 in Chicago, Illinois. I am an aspiring artist, writer, web designer and animator. At a the very young age of three, I knew how to navigate websites and find element codes on a computer. At the age of seven I developed a passion for writing and art.

        <h1>Ice Cream Generator</h1>

        <h2>My Ice Cream Generator project is basically how I used
                    randrange in Python to randomly generate Ice cream flavours
                    and even toppings depending on your personality and
                    name.</h2>

        <h2>SCRATCH AND OTHER PROJECTS</h2>

        <h2>In one game I made, which is called "PIG", it is where
                    one of the two players must hit 100 total and win the game
                    by the roll of the die. Each time they roll, the score will
                    add up unless they roll a one, in which their turn total
                    will reduce to zero and the other player will have a chance
                    to roll. If you click "hold", your turn total will be added
                    to your total score amount.</h2>

        <h2>Jackson Polluck Painting in Khan Academy</h2>

        <h2>This version of a Jackson Polluck Painting with a space
                    girl in it and using Javascript on my own was a bit of a
                    complicated thing as making it multiply every time I moved
                    the mouse was a complicated thing. It took me about three
                    hours or so to get it where I wanted it, but it's still not
                    the best.</h2>
